![taxi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96411307/183914329-746989f4-c7b1-4a35-b5da-69f36572e19a.png)
## :pencil:General overview

This is a web application with backend and frontend parts which simulates work of taxi service.
It supports such functionality as:

- Registration, login and logout
- User authentication and authorization
- User management

Non-authorized users are able to:

    - login to the service with existing crendtials
    - register a new account

Authorized users are able to:

    - use full functionality of the service such as: 
      -> view all drivers and their cars with manufacturers
      -> add and delete new drivers, cars, manufacturers

## Project Structure

The project uses an **N-tier architecture**.
- The application logic tier. Where data is written and read into/from the database.
- The data tier. Where all the data used in your application are stored.
- The presentation tier. This is an interface which interacts with users.

## Implementation details

- **Controller**: processes request from users while **Servlets** implement client-server communication logic.
- **Service**: contains business-logic of the application.
- **DAO**: operates data which stores in the DB, 
containing basic CRUD-operations for communication with the persistence layer.

2. Check a pom.xml file if any errors are occurred - fix them.
3. Configure Apache Tomcat and MySQL.
   -  Add new Tomcat Server configuration and select **war-exploded artifact** to deploy. Set **application context** parameter to "/".
4. Initialize database. It can be local or remote database.
5. Create tables, for this purpose use sql script from resources folder.
6. In the package util, open a **ConnectioUtil** class and set there your credentials instead of dummies for DB connection.
7. Start Tomcat.
8. Test application after it has been successfully risen up:
   - First, you will need to register as a new user. By default, 
unregistered user doesn't have access to the application functionality.
